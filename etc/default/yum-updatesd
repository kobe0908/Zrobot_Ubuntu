# yum-updatesd is used to warn you about the fact that some RPMs might be
# outdated on your system, and need an update.
# As I think that in most cases, we don't need to run the yum-updatesd
# daemon in Debian (yum is used for another purpose than managing the
# system itself, like bootstraping foreign systems), I have decided to
# disable this daemon by default. If you want to re-enable it, just set this
# variable to yes (lower case please). Any other value will disable it.
