        Attachment storage in 1.1 format

            Previously all attachments were plain-text files. They were stored
            in a dictionary where the name denoted the pathname of the attachment
            and the value was an array-of-strings. Each array item was a separate
            line from the text file. Line terminators were preserved.

            The new format is much more flexible and allows to store binary
            files and their mime type. The format stores attachments as an
            array of objects. Each attachment object has tree mandatory
            properties (pathname, contents (base64), and mime_type).

            All existing attachments are migrated to "text/plain" mime type.
            All strings that were previously unicode are encoded to UTF-8,
            concatenated and encoded as base64 (RFC3548) string with standard
            encoding. Previously attachments would be in arbitrary order as
            python dictionaries are not oder-preserving (and indeed json
            recommends that implementations need not retain ordering), in the
            new format attachments are sorted by pathname (just once during the
            conversion process, not in general)
